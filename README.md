My mvp is based on the experience of three users.
User1 knows alot about mixology and what they like. For this user I want to allow the creation of variations to explore twists on classic cocktails they may love.
User2 knows what liquors they like but may not be as familiar. For this user I  want to create a filter by ingredient function to allow them to explore classics with the liquor of their choice
User3 is either adventurous, inexperienced with cocktails or just likes a broad range. For this user I want to create a simple randombutton to come up with a random drink to make.

Stretch goals:
Login 
save drinks
rate and comment on drinks
